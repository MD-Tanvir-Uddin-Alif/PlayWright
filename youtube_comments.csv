That way you save a lot on battery charge cycles (really good for longevity) and only charge the amount you need."

Battery lasts me 2 work days with my use compared to maybe half with the old one, also the camera control is definitely better than most people make it out to be, quick camera launch and the surprisingly the quite useful visual intelligence (at least in my case).

Great vid"

I hope this new vlog style works out. Sorry about the other episode. Just looking at the numbers, YouTube really did categorized you as the ""no BS everyday guy talking new iPhones for real people"". I hope the algorithm lets you expand. Worst case, you'll have a successful tech channel. I haven't subscribed yet to see how the algorithm treats you. The last 3 videos were never recommended to me, just this one. Subscribed now to teach this MF AI that we dig this content. Don't stop, Caster, don't stop!"

Always told that overnight charging degrades battery so I don’t do it. I’ll charge when I get to work and usually 1 hr or less gets me to 80-85% which lasts all day. I just can’t decide which I should go with for a heavy phone user. Don’t need the advanced cameras but I do like battery life. I guess we will see when I go to buy it. Awesome vid!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1ci8RL5n-Q&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,53,"Hey Carter, I just randomly came to your channel and just randomly started loving the videos. I still haven't finished watching this and the moment you were asking for suggestions for the battery in this video I thought I'll share what I practice.

I bought a Mac about 5 months ago and the battery is still at 100% capacity with 63 charge cycles using 2 very simple habit that I've shared below.

Firstly, heat is the biggest battery killer so just try to make sure your phone doesn't get that warm, or if they are warm, try not to use them.

Secondly these batteries love to stay around 50%. Keeping them near 0% / 100% for long durations stresses the chemicals inside these batteries and causes to degrade faster. So try to keep them between 20-80%, or 30-70%, and so on. 20-80% is more realistic."

Also went with Sage but 512GB as I keep everything local and don't use any cloud storage. Been a nice upgrade so far.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpC1M1MddDQ&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,14,Congrats on the huge phone upgrade.. literally xD I went from a 15 Pro 128GB natural titanium to a regular 17 Mist Blue! I love the mist blue since it reminded me of my 13 Pro Sierra blue. I do miss Lidar but I love how light weight the 17 is and the mist blue looks really nice in person/in hnad. I almost got the sage green myself as it was quite tempting! I don't upgrade every yr but aside from losing the telephoto lens and lidar I'm pretty happy with my 17 for the next couple of yrs :D yay 256GB base storage and still getting 120Hz ProMotion. When I went from my 13 Pro to the 15 Pro I was pleasantly surprised at how useful the dynamic island is with its live updates within certain apps for my commute or social media uploads.

The base 17 is the best bang for the buck.  And you're right, the black is more like a dark Space Gray.  I'll wait and see what an Air2 or Air3 has to offer.  But what I'd really like is a thin flip (not foldable) phone."

Overall its not that bad but its definitely an adjustment.

Id totally be tempted to go back to a mini if apple put all the chip and hardware parts into a plateau and gave the mini more battery. I think thatd be biggest redemption for it if it ever happened"

What you can do is map the silent/short cut key to any automation to want. Some people have set it to open a particular app they use like chat got. Or via automation turn on or off lights in a room.

I found the sound from two speakers on the promax really quite commendable. I’m not sure if I could go back but I’m definitely torn because I love the thickness of the air these phones are so radically different. I would normally wait for the next addition just to see how some of these changes settle down and improve. I just don’t know if my current phone will limp to the finish line if I wait another year.

I think people forget that this is its own product, not meant to be the best of the best in the lineup. For me personally, I do not need all the camera functions that come on the other models as I only take photos to capture moments and memories in a snap. When it comes to the battery, I usually always have access to a charger of some sort at home, the car, work etc... Plus I do not use my phone for extensive things other then texting, calling, social media, and the occasional lowkey games. I doubt I will have any true problems with the battery life, and if I do end up getting the MagSafe charger it would be for some vacations or all-day activities and even so I doubt I will need it considering my phone usage.

Hell I'll bet the iPhone 11 will make history with support from Apple.  I'm sure the 13pro's will get even more than the 11's. The iPhones are seriously outstanding when it comes to longevity & liability! Apple knows how to build a device.

Edit: I had the 6s+ for 7+ years. Got it when it came out in 2015. Only in the last 3 months did the battery start to die. I got the 12 in late 2022, and I have no plan to upgrade until this phone startes to fail or gets badly damaged.

Another Edit: I think apple only makes phones worth upgrading to, every 5 years or so. I have the 12. If I make it last 7 years again in 2029 I could jump to the iphone 21* (*whatever it’ll be). The 17 is 5 years from the 12 in 2020 and every phone between now and 2028 can be bough new at a discount. Of course I can switch to a more affordable brand too in a couple years."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,1,"I think people are buying ""Pro"" phone for ""Pro"" status not for features."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,2,Previous best base modal was iPhone 13.. now iPhone 17 took that crown after years!  For the first time we can say base iPhone 17 does provide good value for the price
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,3,"Here’s my honest take on iPhone 17 vs iPhone 16 Pro:

When you’re buying a Pro model, you need at least 256GB storage. In sales, the iPhone 16 Pro (256GB) might drop to around ₹80K, but the chances of actually getting it at that price are less than 5% — within minutes it usually shoots back up to ₹95K–1L. So realistically, it’s very hard to grab at the lowest deal.

Now comparing iPhone 17 vs 16 Pro:

Both have the same ProMotion 120Hz display.

iPhone 17 has a better selfie camera compared to 16 Pro.

17 offers better Wi-Fi connectivity, network bands, and signal reception.

Higher brightness outdoors on 17 vs 16 Pro.

Better battery life on 17, same size as 16 Pro.

Drawbacks with the 17:

Build quality → 16 Pro has titanium, 17 has aluminum (but 17 runs cooler and with better efficiency).

16 Pro gives an extra telephoto lens + optical zoom.

16 Pro has Pro video features (ProRes RAW, SSD recording etc.) which 98% of regular users won’t ever use.

So the bottom line:

If you can grab the 16 Pro 256GB around ₹80K–90K, that’s hands down the best deal.

But once it crosses the ₹1L mark, it makes more sense to go for the iPhone 17 instead. (17 is the new pro)

Definitely avoid choosing the older 16 or 15 base models — the iPhone 17 is the smarter choice for most regular users."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,17,"Apple has a strategy to downgrade the camera quality of older models through software updates. This is their approach. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend opting for the iPhone 16 Pro. Instead, I suggest considering the new iPhone 17, which boasts fresh software and a new camera."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,18,"The 17 is so underrated!! Coming from the 16 pro.. I got the black (wish it was a true black) iPhone 17, i lovee it!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,20,"For those who have never used a pro phone, the telephoto lens on Pros are so good, captures DSLR like portraits. You can only feel the importance of this lens by experiencing yourself, can't be explained in words. I can trade all the features or improvement of 17 just for the Telephoto lens in 16 Pro.
Rest depends on your preference."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,21,"Has anyone noticed how it feels like someone at Apple sat down with their team and held a meeting titled: ""How do we make sure the iPhone 17 Pro series doesn’t end up as the worst upgrade in Apple’s history?""

And the result? Remove the iPhone 17 Plus model — that way, the 17 Pro series feels more important. Now, if someone wants a bigger screen or longer battery life, they're forced to go for the Pro models.

Honestly, if Apple had released the 17 Plus this year, most people (about 95%) wouldn’t need the Pro series. The Plus model would've had everything 95% user actually cares about — a larger display and better battery life. But now, if you want just those two things, you're forced to pay for the Pro Max — even if you don’t care about the “Pro” features.

To those saying the Pro Max offers more — sure, but let’s be real. Years ago, the difference between base and Pro models was meaningful. Now, Apple is clearly out of ideas but still wants to keep the high price tag. So they play these games: removing the Plus model to protect Pro sales, locking popular features behind more expensive models, and pretending it’s all about innovation.

Instead of admitting they can’t justify four iPhones a year anymore, Apple could’ve just offered two: one compact and one large. Then maybe introduce a true foldable and call that the real Pro model. But they’re not interested in actual tech progress — only higher revenue.

They even introduced a new “Slim” model to sit awkwardly between the 17 and 17 Pro, just to make the Pro look more attractive. And of course, they bumped up the Pro’s price too. So now your choices are:
- Get the basic iPhone 17, or
- Pay a lot more for the Pro — even if all you wanted was a bigger battery and screen.

It’s clear Apple doesn’t want to be a leading tech innovator anymore. They want to be a luxury brand, charging premium prices for features that should be standard — keeping things exclusive, not accessible.

Now compare pricing. In the U.S., the iPhone 17 Pro Max is somewhat in line with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. But in India? The Pro Max is almost the same price as the upcoming Galaxy Fold 7. That’s crazy. For Indian buyers, the S25 Ultra is way cheaper than the Pro Max — and if someone has a Pro Max budget, it makes more sense to just spend a little extra and get the Fold 7, which is a real innovation leap.

People often say taxes cause this, but remember — both iPhones and Samsung phones are now assembled in India. Neither is an Indian brand. So why is the price gap between them so much bigger in India than in the U.S.?

Honestly, I hope more Indians stop buying the Pro Max. Apple clearly isn’t thinking about users anymore — just profits. I’m not saying it should be cheap, but at least price it competitively with the S25 Ultra. Right now, Apple’s pricing in India makes zero sense"

i’m going 17 pro this time from a regular iphone 15 because i’ve noticed that my 15 is genuinely falling apart after 2 years of daily use. Doesn’t charge correctly, wireless charging doesn’t work at all, Battery max capacity in the 80s. I hope i can get this 17 pro and stick with it for atleast 3 years without losing crazy battery capacity or just speed over time.


(Edit: If you complain about longevity because it scratches easily, here’s an idea: BUY A CASE?)"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFtoaQX6n0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,15,worth it if coming from ip 13 pro ? i think draw me back is telephoto zoom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFtoaQX6n0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,16,"""the pro does use the telephoto camera all the time"" statement is idiotic when comparing the 2 phones. The use of the main lens instead of the telephoto lens is NOT A PROBLEM APPLE NEEDS TO FIX, all phones do that. Get your facts straight buddy. The telephoto lens is the best feature the iphone 17 pro has, and one of the few reason you should get one."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq9J-oo0jnE&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,7,"I have both. I use both not only for my YT content but also for stock content. For photos I only use the iPhone. For zoomed videos, only the iPhone. But the iPhone is only for still or panning video. You can’t walk with the iPhone without a gimbal, it’s jittery. That’s where I stop using the iPhone, as putting it even on a phone gimbal is bigger and less portable than the pocket 3. That’s when I start using the pocket 3. Walking it’s a camera and a gimbal in one and way smaller than an iPhone on a gimbal. But then again when it rains it’s useless so I go back to iPhone for still and pans, as no phone gimbal is waterproof. I record using ProRes on the iPhone in Log. Colors are better but the pocket has a bigger sensor and less video noise. I hope the upcoming pocket 4 will record in a higher bitrate as about 80 that it does now in 24-25 fps is not much. But on the other hand the pocket 3 records in constant frame rate, while the iPhone fluctuates. If you try to record in open gate, in order to get constant frame rate, you lose stabilisation and video denoising. I could go on but I hope you understand why there can never be a winner and as I started mentioning l use both, depending on the scenario."

Background blur? OP3 wins - this is very important since the most comun use case would be the vlog and you want to isolate the subject. Audio quality? OP3 wins, especially because you can connect the mics INCLUDING the dji mic 3 with 32bit float as a backup. The big wins for the iphone:  you'll always have it with you and it has multiple focals.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4lj6K7HkY&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,36,"First - I really appreciate your videos. But I bought both this spigen and slightly more expensive ESR and:
Apart from numbers which I am not able to test, it’s pretty much worse in every way from my slightly more expensive ESR. 
Glass protection - ESR is deep on top and bottom making it usable from the corners and safer when face dropped. 
Camera button - it’s decent on ESR. 
Buttons - just as bad. 
Camera protection - much better on ESR. 
ESR is just as good with MagSafe charger from apple but better when mounting it on my steel squat rack.
All of that for £2 more than this spigen.
I’ve ordered both and returned spigen. ESR also feels better on the corners but I won’t drop it on purpose. 

That said - I really appreciate your reviews and it’s possible that we talk about different ESR case - I bought mine in UK for ~£17 while spigen for ~15.
It’s for me temporary case while I wait on peak design to be delivered as I mount my phone on motorbike."

It is a very interesting product.

I do not care what these people think. Just give me the data and let me decide.

Probably to do with the width  of the phone being less than the Max one he's testing so less flex and slip off. So far I'm happy with it, I did get the spigen one he's testing here and it was definitely slimmer than the esr but I did not feel confident that it offered enough protection. Get the ESR for the not Max version."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4lj6K7HkY&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,54,"You make absolutely no sense. Not only does the ESR hybrid case have 2 Airbags in each corner compared to only 1 small Airbag on the Spigen hybrid case but the ESR case has a physical camera control button. The camera control button itself is a MUST which automatically by itself gives ESR the WIN but the extra Airbags pushes ESR way past Spigens hybrid case. In terms of materials both cases are 100% identical with the exact same materials used in the same places. The ESR does also have a way stronger MagSafe Magnet . Also, the ESR hybrid case has its edges of around the screen raised a bit and it keeps your display from touching the ground even when a screen protector is installed. Idk where you get this claim it’s better than the ESR and totally skip comparing the two. That’s clear enough to assume you’re not just a reviewer anymore. Congratulations."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qecoAFeQ0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,50,"As a Pro Max user with 1tb of storage, I'm hoping I can get by with the 17 with 512GB of storage. Most of my storage used to be from storing music directly on my device, but since I have unlimited data, I'll be relying on that now"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,5,The caseless feel is sooo smooth! Agree with you!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qecoAFeQ0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,51,Traded my 13 Pro Max for 17. Knew i was done with large screen phones and wanted the smallest screen new iPhone.  Its so lightweight and feels great in my hand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qecoAFeQ0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,52,Homestly  I can’t see the difference between 60 and 120 display. I have iPad 6 and iPhone 15 pro max and iPad Pro and I see nothing different

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,9,I rock my iPhone without a case but I feel paranoid all the time but some thing that helped me a lot is using a silicone case it has the same smoothness and comfort.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,11,made the same switch thanks for making this review!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qecoAFeQ0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,57,If 17 and 16 pro the same price what should i buy? Its 1000+ so should i just go for 16 pro max or 16 plus under 1000 would be good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,13,I traded up from the base 15 to the base 17. I do use a case. I'm not risking a scratch much less a cracked screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_qecoAFeQ0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,59,I also have an anker MagSafe charger. Anker products are solid.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,16,"I have purchased my first iPhone, which is the 17 base model and blue in color. Previously, I have always used Android phones, so I was quite speculative about my decision to purchase an iPhone. But honestly, this was my best decision and I don't regret it."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,21,"Upgraded to base 17 from base 13. Really loved it until it started bugging after two weeks. Touch screen is not reactive sometimes, and safari browsing bugs a bit. Will go to apple store to check with them. Wondering if it's an iphone issue or IOS. I'm using iphones since 4s, had iphone 6, 8 plus, 13, and never had any issues."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,22,Wow thats the exact colour I was looking for on my next iPhone I currently have the 15 pro and iOS26 is draining my battery plus I find the phone heavy  I’m definitely a case person. I don’t normally drop my phone but it’s just piece of mine plus adding a screen protector is a must imo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,23,"I knew going into the Apple Store this was the phone I was getting bcuz of two things, Pro motion and double the storage…I took that extra 300 saved and got the new APP 3’s win win"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,24,I went 15 pro max to 16 plus and regret it. The only thing I regret is not keeping my telephoto camera. My daughter plays sports so not having great zoom sucks. So thankfully my plan lets me upgrade so I’ll get the 17 pro or pro max for that zoom.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,25,"Of course I subscribed.
Really good and satisfying video."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,26,I’ve traded my 15 Pro in on the 17. Haven’t received it yet because there’s a 2 to 3 week wait. I always use a case and screen protector. I ordered them before I ordered my phone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,27,"From 13 Pro Max to base 17. I thought the smaller screen would be a turnoff, I was actually surprised how great smaller phone feels like."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,28,"What screen protector do you use? I have seen better antireflective results on other videos, do you think the screenprotector is making it worse?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,29,"The RAM is 8GB. If you tend to hold on to your phones for 3-4 years, better get the Pro."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,31,I preferred iPhone 16 Pro over iPhone 17 and I’m happy. It looks more premium and have premium features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,32,should we get the iphone 16 pro max if we would like to do more on filming or taking pictures? I like iphone 17 also due to the size but I would like to have a better camera performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,33,Just ordered this in lavander from Iphone 16 Pro max which is too heavy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,34,"How was your experience about the storage size, is it enough for a casual user who plays games (like games you have there), should you suggest the 512gb version? or 256gb is enough? Do you think 256gb will last me for at least 4 to 5 years?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,35,how's the battery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,36,All I can say that it's way better than the Air regardless of its screen size and weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,37,Is battery really that good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,38,I would prefer to use my phone case less but I am afraid I will break it. So I do use a case but those extra thin made from Kevlar. Not providing 100% but at least the grip compared to not having any carbon is far better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,39,The USB 2 though.  That's a hard pill to swallow in 2025.  Iphone 18 base will probably have USB 3 which will be my upgrade from my XS MAX.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,40,I am case persone for gripping ...and a I cannot understand why screen protectors exist ... I have never used one! : ) .. never will

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,50,"the problem is that 
- the Iphone 17 cost 952.55 euros in my area and the 
- Vivo X 200 Pro is available from China at 623 euros

so ... no need mentioning that the X 200 Pro makes the Iphone 17 look like a toy ...but considering the difference in price on top of it ... the 17 will go back tomorrow.... I'll keep the 200 Pro."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbWbCek3mlo&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3,53,"Switching from pixel to iphone is the worst decision of my life. Nobody talks about the glitch the bugs and so much inconveniences. 

1. There's no global back button 
2. The keyboard is shit. It won't show you the preview of what you are typing.
3. It doesn't even have simple copy from photo option, where you can copy the details of the documents and paste in the clipboard or something.
4. Oh yeah everytime you want to change the orientation to landscape you have to unlock the rotation. So good luck watching videos on website with portrait mode. 
5. ITS TOO MUCH CLICKS and forget to do any task fast. Everything seems slow because of the UI itself.

I have thrown the phone out of frustration many times it's not even a month."
