That way you save a lot on battery charge cycles (really good for longevity) and only charge the amount you need.

Battery lasts me 2 work days with my use compared to maybe half with the old one, also the camera control is definitely better than most people make it out to be, quick camera launch and the surprisingly the quite useful visual intelligence (at least in my case).

I hope this new vlog style works out. Sorry about the other episode. Just looking at the numbers, YouTube really did categorized you as the "no BS everyday guy talking new iPhones for real people". I hope the algorithm lets you expand. Worst case, you'll have a successful tech channel. I haven't subscribed yet to see how the algorithm treats you. The last 3 videos were never recommended to me, just this one. Subscribed now to teach this MF AI that we dig this content. Don't stop, Caster, don't stop!

I am the same as you are with charging. Always told that overnight charging degrades battery so I don’t do it. I’ll charge when I get to work and usually 1 hr or less gets me to 80-85% which lasts all day. I just can’t decide which I should go with for a heavy phone user. Don’t need the advanced cameras but I do like battery life. I guess we will see when I go to buy it. Awesome vid!

1. Overnight charging (wired) with 100% limit along with optimised charging turned on
2. Enable 80% or 90% limit, and leave your phone plugged in overnight, or just charge it during the day

I still haven't finished watching this and the moment you were asking for suggestions for the battery in this video I thought I'll share what I practice.

I bought a Mac about 5 months ago and the battery is still at 100% capacity with 63 charge cycles using 2 very simple habit that I've shared below.

Firstly, heat is the biggest battery killer so just try to make sure your phone doesn't get that warm, or if they are warm, try not to use them.

Secondly these batteries love to stay around 50%. Keeping them near 0% / 100% for long durations stresses the chemicals inside these batteries and causes to degrade faster. So try to keep them between 20-80%, or 30-70%, and so on. 20-80% is more realistic.

I think they did well boosting the storage while a lot of companies are still doing 128 as base.

I love the mist blue since it reminded me of my 13 Pro Sierra blue. I do miss Lidar but I love how light weight the 17 is and the mist blue looks really nice in person/in hnad. I almost got the sage green myself as it was quite tempting! I don't upgrade every yr but aside from losing the telephoto lens and lidar I'm pretty happy with my 17 for the next couple of yrs :D yay 256GB base storage and still getting 120Hz ProMotion. When I went from my 13 Pro to the 15 Pro I was pleasantly surprised at how useful the dynamic island is with its live updates within certain apps for my commute or social media uploads.

The base 17 is the best bang for the buck.  And you're right, the black is more like a dark Space Gray.  I'll wait and see what an Air2 or Air3 has to offer.  But what I'd really like is a thin flip (not foldable) phone.

And I use only phone stuff with it - if I want to watch YT or brows and do not want to use the Laptop (that is always around), then I use my iPad.
My phone is now roughly 4 years old and only now the battery gets a bit weaker, but still holds for several days. And if the battery will finally get too annoying, I can simply buy a new battery and switch it - without even needing a screwdriver.

Overall its not that bad but its definitely an adjustment.

Id totally be tempted to go back to a mini if apple put all the chip and hardware parts into a plateau and gave the mini more battery. I think thatd be biggest redemption for it if it ever happened

What you can do is map the silent/short cut key to any automation to want. Some people have set it to open a particular app they use like chat got. Or via automation turn on or off lights in a room. This is one good reason to upgrade.

As a lifelong Android user, that really surprised me as I was expecting to see at least 85% stability because of how much Apple talks about their cooling and how much their users glaze their sustained performance.

Would love to know your thoughts. The promax has two speakers the iPhone air just one when connecting to an external speaker. Not much difference but scrolling late at night in bed. I found the sound from two speakers on the promax really quite commendable. I’m not sure if I could go back but I’m definitely torn because I love the thickness of the air these phones are so radically different. I would normally wait for the next addition just to see how some of these changes settle down and improve. I just don’t know if my current phone will limp to the finish line if I wait another year.

I think people forget that this is its own product, not meant to be the best of the best in the lineup. For me personally, I do not need all the camera functions that come on the other models as I only take photos to capture moments and memories in a snap. When it comes to the battery, I usually always have access to a charger of some sort at home, the car, work etc... Plus I do not use my phone for extensive things other then texting, calling, social media, and the occasional lowkey games. I doubt I will have any true problems with the battery life, and if I do end up getting the MagSafe charger it would be for some vacations or all-day activities and even so I doubt I will need it considering my phone usage. The thinness and weight is a bonus for me, considering all of the things I mentioned above!

Aluminum has a much higher thermal conductivity (about 237 W/m·K) than titanium (about 21.9 W/m·K), making it a much better heat conductor. 5:52

Hell I'll bet the iPhone 11 will make history with support from Apple.  I'm sure the 13pro's will get even more than the 11's. The iPhones are seriously outstanding when it comes to longevity & liability! Apple knows how to build a device.

Love the screen, yet there are some things that in other phones like the Oppo one you just picked up, that I really want. Yet on the list that of my pros for staying with this device, it is high on the list.

Edit: I had the 6s+ for 7+ years. Got it when it came out in 2015. Only in the last 3 months did the battery start to die. I got the 12 in late 2022, and I have no plan to upgrade until this phone startes to fail or gets badly damaged.

Another Edit: I think apple only makes phones worth upgrading to, every 5 years or so. I have the 12. If I make it last 7 years again in 2029 I could jump to the iphone 21* (*whatever it’ll be). The 17 is 5 years from the 12 in 2020 and every phone between now and 2028 can be bough new at a discount. Of course I can switch to a more affordable brand too in a couple years.

2025-11-02 10:24:04,558 - INFO - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3 | Comment 3: Here’s my honest take on iPhone 17 vs iPhone 16 Pro:

When you’re buying a Pro model, you need at least 256GB storage. In sales, the iPhone 16 Pro (256GB) might drop to around \u20b980K, but the chances of actually getting it at that price are less than 5% — within minutes it usually shoots back up to \u20b995K–1L. So realistically, it’s very hard to grab at the lowest deal.

Now comparing iPhone 17 vs 16 Pro:

Both have the same ProMotion 120Hz display.

iPhone 17 has a better selfie camera compared to 16 Pro.

17 offers better Wi-Fi connectivity, network bands, and signal reception.

Higher brightness outdoors on 17 vs 16 Pro.

Better battery life on 17, same size as 16 Pro.

Drawbacks with the 17:

Build quality \u2192 16 Pro has titanium, 17 has aluminum (but 17 runs cooler and with better efficiency).

16 Pro gives an extra telephoto lens + optical zoom.

16 Pro has Pro video features (ProRes RAW, SSD recording etc.) which 98% of regular users won’t ever use.

So the bottom line:

If you can grab the 16 Pro 256GB around \u20b980K–90K, that’s hands down the best deal.

But once it crosses the \u20b91L mark, it makes more sense to go for the iPhone 17 instead. (17 is the new pro)

Definitely avoid choosing the older 16 or 15 base models — the iPhone 17 is the smarter choice for most regular users.

You can only feel the importance of this lens by experiencing yourself, can't be explained in words. I can trade all the features or improvement of 17 just for the Telephoto lens in 16 Pro.
Rest depends on your preference.
2025-11-02 10:24:04,841 - INFO - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLSv2uVbd8w&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3 | Comment 21: Has anyone noticed how it feels like someone at Apple sat down with their team and held a meeting titled: "How do we make sure the iPhone 17 Pro series doesn’t end up as the worst upgrade in Apple’s history?"

And the result? Remove the iPhone 17 Plus model — that way, the 17 Pro series feels more important. Now, if someone wants a bigger screen or longer battery life, they're forced to go for the Pro models.

Honestly, if Apple had released the 17 Plus this year, most people (about 95%) wouldn’t need the Pro series. The Plus model would've had everything 95% user actually cares about — a larger display and better battery life. But now, if you want just those two things, you're forced to pay for the Pro Max — even if you don’t care about the “Pro” features.

To those saying the Pro Max offers more — sure, but let’s be real. Years ago, the difference between base and Pro models was meaningful. Now, Apple is clearly out of ideas but still wants to keep the high price tag. So they play these games: removing the Plus model to protect Pro sales, locking popular features behind more expensive models, and pretending it’s all about innovation.

Instead of admitting they can’t justify four iPhones a year anymore, Apple could’ve just offered two: one compact and one large. Then maybe introduce a true foldable and call that the real Pro model. But they’re not interested in actual tech progress — only higher revenue.

They even introduced a new “Slim” model to sit awkwardly between the 17 and 17 Pro, just to make the Pro look more attractive. And of course, they bumped up the Pro’s price too. So now your choices are:
- Get the basic iPhone 17, or
- Pay a lot more for the Pro — even if all you wanted was a bigger battery and screen.

It’s clear Apple doesn’t want to be a leading tech innovator anymore. They want to be a luxury brand, charging premium prices for features that should be standard — keeping things exclusive, not accessible.

Now compare pricing. In the U.S., the iPhone 17 Pro Max is somewhat in line with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. But in India? The Pro Max is almost the same price as the upcoming Galaxy Fold 7. That’s crazy. For Indian buyers, the S25 Ultra is way cheaper than the Pro Max — and if someone has a Pro Max budget, it makes more sense to just spend a little extra and get the Fold 7, which is a real innovation leap.

People often say taxes cause this, but remember — both iPhones and Samsung phones are now assembled in India. Neither is an Indian brand. So why is the price gap between them so much bigger in India than in the U.S.?

Honestly, I hope more Indians stop buying the Pro Max. Apple clearly isn’t thinking about users anymore — just profits. I’m not saying it should be cheap, but at least price it competitively with the S25 Ultra. Right now, Apple’s pricing in India makes zero sense

17 is really a better choice any day except for telephoto lens and usb 3 17 is better option also hardly people will get it at that flipkart price they showed

2025-11-02 10:24:05,447 - INFO - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFtoaQX6n0&pp=ygUJaXBob25lIDE3 | Comment 2: The Pros camera is better and it’s just built to last longer than a regular 17. The 17 is for people who swap phones every year or few years and the pro is for people that want to have longevity and not swap their phone every year (in theory, but we know the brainrotten apple marketing victims get the new pro model every year)

i’m going 17 pro this time from a regular iphone 15 because i’ve noticed that my 15 is genuinely falling apart after 2 years of daily use. Doesn’t charge correctly, wireless charging doesn’t work at all, Battery max capacity in the 80s. I hope i can get this 17 pro and stick with it for atleast 3 years without losing crazy battery capacity or just speed over time.


(Edit: If you complain about longevity because it scratches easily, here’s an idea: BUY A CASE?)

The use of the main lens instead of the telephoto lens is NOT A PROBLEM APPLE NEEDS TO FIX, all phones do that. Get your facts straight buddy. The telephoto lens is the best feature the iphone 17 pro has, and one of the few reason you should get one.

They probably decided closer to the release date that Google was a threat.

A small correction for the Vertical Video statement starting at 4:54. The Pocket 3 absolutely will shoot 4K Vertical Video by simply holding the Pocket 3 in a horizontal position. I shoot 4K Vertical Video all the time with my Pocket 3 and even have tripod stands that hold the camera in this horizontal position. 4:54

For photos I only use the iPhone. For zoomed videos, only the iPhone. But the iPhone is only for still or panning video. You can’t walk with the iPhone without a gimbal, it’s jittery. That’s where I stop using the iPhone, as putting it even on a phone gimbal is bigger and less portable than the pocket 3. That’s when I start using the pocket 3. Walking it’s a camera and a gimbal in one and way smaller than an iPhone on a gimbal. But then again when it rains it’s useless so I go back to iPhone for still and pans, as no phone gimbal is waterproof. I record using ProRes on the iPhone in Log. Colors are better but the pocket has a bigger sensor and less video noise. I hope the upcoming pocket 4 will record in a higher bitrate as about 80 that it does now in 24-25 fps is not much. But on the other hand the pocket 3 records in constant frame rate, while the iPhone fluctuates. If you try to record in open gate, in order to get constant frame rate, you lose stabilisation and video denoising. I could go on but I hope you understand why there can never be a winner and as I started mentioning l use both, depending on the scenario.

Being able to record yourself with a monitor? OP3 wins. Background blur? OP3 wins - this is very important since the most comun use case would be the vlog and you want to isolate the subject. Audio quality? OP3 wins, especially because you can connect the mics INCLUDING the dji mic 3 with 32bit float as a backup. The big wins for the iphone:  you'll always have it with you and it has multiple focals. Both are amazing, love having them both :P EDIT: if forced to only have one, would go with the iphone if the budget allows...

As well as the improved quality of the 4x/8x lens over the 5x lens of 16 Pro. I skipped the 16 Pro for these reasons and kept the 15 Pro for the 3x lens, Happy that Apple did what photographers wanted with the telephoto lens...Much more usable focal length and image quality. (More zoom reach is not how we grade lenses) But I get your more into video. Now I wish Apple would catch up to Chinese Camera phone makers..

Apart from numbers which I am not able to test, it’s pretty much worse in every way from my slightly more expensive ESR. 
Glass protection - ESR is deep on top and bottom making it usable from the corners and safer when face dropped. 
Camera button - it’s decent on ESR. 
Buttons - just as bad. 
Camera protection - much better on ESR. 
ESR is just as good with MagSafe charger from apple but better when mounting it on my steel squat rack.
All of that for £2 more than this spigen.
I’ve ordered both and returned spigen. ESR also feels better on the corners but I won’t drop it on purpose. 

That said - I really appreciate your reviews and it’s possible that we talk about different ESR case - I bought mine in UK for ~£17 while spigen for ~15.
It’s for me temporary case while I wait on peak design to be delivered as I mount my phone on motorbike.

It is a very interesting product. 

I have seen positive reviews about it. But nobody offers data besides you. 

I do not care what these people think. Just give me the data and let me decide. 

The ONLY review you have given that was wrong is your review of Apple’s first MagSafe battery. 

I purchased one of those batteries and it  lasts longer than my 5k Anker MagSafe battery.

Probably to do with the width  of the phone being less than the Max one he's testing so less flex and slip off. So far I'm happy with it, I did get the spigen one he's testing here and it was definitely slimmer than the esr but I did not feel confident that it offered enough protection. Get the ESR for the not Max version.

The camera control button itself is a MUST which automatically by itself gives ESR the WIN but the extra Airbags pushes ESR way past Spigens hybrid case. In terms of materials both cases are 100% identical with the exact same materials used in the same places. The ESR does also have a way stronger MagSafe Magnet . Also, the ESR hybrid case has its edges of around the screen raised a bit and it keeps your display from touching the ground even when a screen protector is installed. Idk where you get this claim it’s better than the ESR and totally skip comparing the two. That’s clear enough to assume you’re not just a reviewer anymore. Congratulations.

Some subtle difference I noticed is the macro mode is activated earlier in pro model (this means in 17 base model you have to get bit closer to the object to get the macro mode kick in). I consider this as an advantage of pro.

The main differences between the 16 and 17, for me, are the screen and the storage. Otherwise, the overall experience should be about the same.

I will make the upgrade next year.  Either to the 18 which I hope will significantly benefit from AI technology, or if not, then the 17 at a slight discount.

Really loved it until it started bugging after two weeks. Touch screen is not reactive sometimes, and safari browsing bugs a bit. Will go to apple store to check with them. Wondering if it's an iphone issue or IOS. I'm using iphones since 4s, had iphone 6, 8 plus, 13, and never had any issues.

- Vivo X 200 Pro is available from China at 623 euros

so ... no need mentioning that the X 200 Pro makes the Iphone 17 look like a toy ...but considering the difference in price on top of it ... the 17 will go back tomorrow.... I'll keep the 200 Pro.

1. There's no global back button 
2. The keyboard is shit. It won't show you the preview of what you are typing.
3. It doesn't even have simple copy from photo option, where you can copy the details of the documents and paste in the clipboard or something.
4. Oh yeah everytime you want to change the orientation to landscape you have to unlock the rotation. So good luck watching videos on website with portrait mode. 
5. ITS TOO MUCH CLICKS and forget to do any task fast. Everything seems slow because of the UI itself.

I have thrown the phone out of frustration many times it's not even a month.
